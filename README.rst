Sheffield High Performance Computing Documentation
==================================================

This is the source for the documentation of Bessemer and ShARC, The University of Sheffield's High Performance Computing clusters.

It is written in the reStructuredText_ (*rst*) format and the Sphinx_ tool is used to convert this to a set of HTML pages.

For a guide on the rst file format see `this <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ document.

Rendered Documentation
----------------------
`This website <https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/>`_  is currently automatically built from this repository:
each push to the ``master`` branch causes the `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ service to
build and serve the documentation.

The ReadTheDocs build configuration is stored in the ``.readthedocs.yaml`` file with the Python version pinned to 3.7 and the Pip 
requirements file. The requirements file is ``requirements.txt``.

Please note that the use of the ``.readthedocs.yaml`` file will also override certain web UI settings set in the ReadTheDocs administrative panel.


How to Contribute
-----------------
To contribute to this documentation, first you have to fork it on GitHub and clone it to your machine,
see `Fork a Repo <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ for the GitHub documentation on this process.

Once you have the git repository locally on your computer,
you will need to ensure you have Python and the Tox_ build tool installed.

Once you have made your changes and updated your Fork on GitHub you will need to `Open a Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_.
All changes to the repository should be made through Pull Requests, including those made by the people with direct push access.

Building the documentation on a local Windows machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Install **Python 3** on your machine by downloading and running the `Miniconda installer`_:

   * Install for *just you*;
   * Install to the default location (e.g. ``C:\Users\myusername\Miniconda3``);
   * Do **not** *add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable*;
   * Do **not** *register Anaconda as your default Python 3*.

#. Click *Start* -> *Anaconda3 (64-bit)* -> *Anaconda Prompt* to open a terminal window.

#. Create a new *conda environment* for building the documentation by running the following from this window: ::

    conda create --name sheffield_hpc python=3.7
    conda activate sheffield_hpc	# . activate sheffield_hpc on older versions of conda
    pip install tox

#. To build the HTML documentation run: ::

    tox -e py37

The output should be written to ``./_build/html``.

Building the documentation on a local Linux machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Ensure one of Python 3.9 or 3.7 are installed.
#. Ensure the Tox_ build tool is installed and can be used/seen by your chosen Python interpreter.

#. Run Tox to create an isolated Python virtual environment then build documentation: ::

     tox -e py37  # OR
     tox -e py39

The output should be written to ``./_build/html``.

Building the documentation on a local Mac machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Ensure Python 3 is installed.  If you do not already have a python distribution installed, we recommend you install :ref:`Miniconda <Miniconda installer>`.
#. Install the Python packages needed to build the HTML documentation.  If you are using (mini)conda create a new *conda environment* for building the documentation by running: ::

    export PATH=${HOME}/miniconda3/bin:$PATH
    conda create -n sheffield_hpc python=3.7
    conda activate sheffield_hpc	# . activate sheffield_hpc on older versions of conda
    pip install tox

#. To build the HTML documentation run::

    tox -e py37

The output should be written to ``./_build/html``.

Check external links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do this with: ::

   tox -e py37-linkcheck

Continuous build and serve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build and serve the site and automatically rebuild when source files change: ::

   tox -e py37-livehtml

Testing the building of the documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The validity of the reStructuredText in this repo and the ability to convert that to HTML with Sphinx can be tested in three ways:

* Locally by contributors when they run e.g. ``tox -e py37-livehtml``
* By a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rcgsheffield/sheffield_hpc/actions/) Workflow each time a contributor creates or updates a Pull Request.
* By `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/projects/iceberg/>`__ on each push to the ``master`` branch.

Important files / folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``conf.py`` - Sphinx configuration file.
* ``requirements.txt`` - Main requirements file.
* ``setuptoolsrequirements.txt`` - Initial requirements file set in order to first pin setuptools to version 57.5.0 to `retain support for the current theme <https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/issues/216>`__.
* ``tox.ini`` - Tox configuration file.
* ``.readthedocs.yaml`` - ReadTheDocs configuration file (must match the PIP requirements.)
* ``Makefile`` 
* ``global.rst`` - A globally included file (goes into all pages) which is excluded from direct building using exclude_patterns in ``conf.py``.
* ``referenceinfo/imports`` - sub-folder tree of files to be included by not directly built. This is excluded from direct building using exclude_patterns in ``conf.py``.
* ``_static/css/custom.css`` - custom CSS overrides for the theme.

(Re)-generating PNG images from Mermaid.js diagram definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some diagrams, such as ``images/hpcgateway-sequence-diag.png`` 
have been generated with `mermaid-cli <https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli>`__ 
and Mermaid.js diagram definitions such as ``images/hpcgateway-sequence-diag.mmd``.
How to install mermaid-cli and regenerate one of these diagrams: ::

  yarn add @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli 
  ./node_modules/.bin/mmdc -i images/hpcgateway-sequence-diag.mmd -o images/hpcgateway-sequence-diag.png
