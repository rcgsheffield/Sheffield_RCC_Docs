Object Storage / S3
=======================================

Object Storage created in the :term:`RCC` platform has similar access restrictions to the instances.
To access Ronin object storage (other than from a Ronin instance) you will need to be connected to the university VPN.

For those unfamiliar, object storage in Ronin is very much like shared storage, behaving like folder for you to store and retrieve files from multiple different computers.
The most notable difference with object storage is that you don't generally have it mounted to your computer like an additional drive.

.. note:: 

    The term "object/s" here is synonymous with the term "file/s"

Accessing Object Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned previously access to your object storage from outside the machines in your project is restricted to the VPN.
This somewhat complicates how you connect to your object storage from what AWS would consider the norm as special restrictions are in place.
